# Patent analysis Final presentation

## Group 2 

- general
  - Criteria weighing
    - Most important things
  - technology and commercialization
    - commercialization has more factors to consider
  - classification
    - boundary conditions
    - linkage to others
  - patent technology
    - quality is the central to the patent
- cipher
  - classification
    - are difficult to use esp, when patent portolio is small??
      - Start with original classification
      - Which is a good way to locate
  - power cross comparison
    - of company portfolio
  - clear visualization
    - esp vs lens
  - limitations of AI
    - but humans required to analyze
  - PVIX criteria
    - can you trust it with small subsets
      - Start with some domain classifications
    - Take your understanding for the domain

## Improvement suggestions

- automated slicing and dicing of generated patents
- advanced ai for qualitative assessment criteria and interpretation of context
  - estimated cost to implement, environmental, and friendliness
- summary ai will 

## Best enough technology

## Group 1

- 

## Search methodology

- utilization of different methodologies to find viale companies
- filtering obtain shortlist for each initial search methods
  - geo
    - asia
    - eu
  - number of patent families
    - Number of patent families
    - more than 1
  - combine shortlists for evaluation
    - use data charts on cipher to evaluate potential of company
    - evaluate criteria
      - size of portfolio families
      - geographical region
      - patenting activitiy
      - patent portofolio strength
  - final four companies to compare

## Initial methodology

- initial methods 1
- initial search method 2
  - keyword search on cipher to collect relevant patent families
    - eg 
      - cpc code
      - Windshield 
      - windscreen 
      - Pvb?
    - returned 757072 families
  - download results as csv
  - python for data analysis


## Comparison of initial search methods

- method 1
  - corning inc
  - hyundai motor
  - agc
  - lg
- method
  - 2

## Portfolio size (active families by organisations, currently active patent families by organization)

- corning inc
- hyundai motor group
- agc
- lg electronics inc

## Patent geographical region strategy

- Key interest regions
  - Japan
  - Korea
  - China
  - Taiwan
  - EPO
  - German

## Patent activity

- patent activity families by origanization and prior year

## Patent portfolio strength

- PVIX
  - Portfolio Value Index by organization and priority year

## Comparison of 4 potential companies

- 

## Conclusion

- corning inc is most appropriate choice
- there were viavle options, good for future expansion
- unfortunate that hyundai was not better performing, given our existing links due to licensing their patent

## two question

- two search
  - one cipher
  - one python analysis
- which company to report
  - 1 most important
  - 2 subsitutes for the short list



## Venterator group

- Group
- Us market
- commercialization
- partners
- high relevance in the medical domains
- manufacturing and design of the venternalization cells

## Methods

- 77 COMPANIES
  - landscape search using cipher classifier provided
  - Filter by countries of interest
  - filter by activeness
  - filter by date (expiry and priority)
- 7 companies
  - Re
- 3 companies
  - Decision matrix

## Filter by patent expirationsy and priority dates

- becton Dickinson avanos
- private owner
- koninklije
- metronic
- air liquide
- smiths group international holding
- emergency pulmonary

## Filter by geography

- Highest number of patents overall
- IMEA
- EURASIA
- Australasia
- Other
- North America
- Europe
- East Asia

## Internal finders

- Regina manufacturs
- existing supply chains
- knowhow of local markets

## Key factor partner selection

- technical competency
  - Becton Dickinson
  - Air liquide
  - Avanos medical
- quality of patent portolio
  - Becton Dickinson
  - Air liquide
  - Avanos medical
- regional
- **negotational leverage??**
  - If it is a large company, then potentially, it is hard to negotational leverage

## Technical competency by portfolio size 

- active patent families

- pending patent families

## quality of patent portfolio (classified - general)

- size and pvix
- **size and p(what is the two difference?)**

## Cipher

- 

## Conclusion

- Both in Latin and 
- same classifier
- Useful to run reports on companies without classifiers



## Hydronic group 4

## Active families by top 25 organisations



## Overview top patent owners in Hydrogen Fuel Cells



## Previously on the selected patents



- hYDROGEN GENERATION BY 

## hYDROGEN fUEL cELL

- Top applicants
  - Pr
- Document count

## Hydrogen Fuel Cell- Control via Lens



## Evaluation of Potential Partner (Via Lens)

- Score the potential partner by
  - number of ownership
  - number of applicaation
  - domain coverage
  - company size
  - jurisdiction coverage
- potential partners

## Publication year trend until 2021- Granted families top 10 countries

- China is dominating the Granted families
- Decendin

## Active Size Groth 2016-2021 Top 25 Organisation



## Active size growth 2016-2021 top 15 organizations in China



## Active Families by Regions- Top 15 organisations



## Elimination on the list so far

- Chinese

## Market interest

- how they have spend the companies in the market

 

## Expertise in target field



## Our reasoning- Portfolio Age



## Our Reasoning Growthing



- Groth rate
- expertise in target field



## Aggregiation on the data

- Code assigning
- companies
- Look at inventories

## Group 5

- international commercialization

## Methods

- avoid automative major players
- look for new actors want to enter

## Methods

- Possibility of different partners for different markets
- priority to Aisian

## Methods

- Cipher

## Step by step

- Using provided Cipher Classifier
- selecting regions
  - north america
  - asia
- exclusing organizations
  - private owners
  - uni
  - academy
  - research institutes and next 
- look at the top 20 active families
- exclude unrelated results
  - Gas and oil
  - batteries
  - bikes
- companies comparision

## Step 4

- Top 20 active familes
- not many cross market actors

## Asia

- 

## Step 



## Step 6 companies



## Asian Market-PVIX normalized



## Step 6

- Wuhan's hydrogen city

## North America

- Active families

## North America Market - Family Age at Expiry



## North America Market- Pending families



## Doosan Develop Hydrogen Power



## Doosan



## Challenges



## False positive, negative 



## False negative



- 

## Evaluation

- Commercialisation 
- How to weight variables
- Granted, Pending, PVIX, etc
- Is patent based analysis sufficient, Tesla, and Arm



## Tesla patent has allowed others to do

- commercialization partners s

## Potential not always work 



## Post market lanuch patent launch



## Company background assumptions
