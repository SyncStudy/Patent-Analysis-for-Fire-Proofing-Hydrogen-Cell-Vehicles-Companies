## Data lifecycle

- creating data
- processing data
- analyzing data

- preserving data
- giving access to your data
- re-use data

## Why

- increased efficiency
- preservation
  - Data need to be in the domain
- funder mandates
  - Have the follow the mandates from the founder's perspectives 
- good academic practice
  - It is the things that making the evidence based level for your academic reputations

## Areas of data management

- four key areas of data management
  - creation and reuse
  - organization
  - Storage and backup
  - sharing

## Creating and reusing data

- not all data needed to be created
  - datasets can be reused
- think about your own research
  - are you creating your own data or 
  - reusing existing data
- what do you need to think about?
  - data privacy
  - ethics
  - liscening
  - quality

## Issues to consider

### Creating your own data

- set standards scale
- hardware and software
- think about to capture about the data
- decide where to store your data
- choose how to license and share

### Both

- critical appraisal and reflection
- transpoarency and reproductibility
- visualization
- version control
- ethics

### Using other's data

- understanding metadata
- deal with interoperability and consistency
- familiarise yourself with context
- access issues
- Understand licenses and permissions for using it

## FAIR data principles

### Findable

- first step 
- Metadata and data should be easy to find
  - human
  - computer
- machine readable metadata
  - automatic discovery 
    - datasets
    - services

### Accessible

- finds the required data
- know how they can be accessed
- possibly including authentication and authorization 

### Interoperable

- integrated with other data
- interoperate with applications or workflows
- anaysis storage and processing

### Reusable

- ultimate goal of FAIR
- optimize the reuse of data
- to achieve this 
- metadata and data in well-described
- replicated
- combined in different settings

## Organising data: metadata

- metadata
  - any other descriptive document
  - help secondary users 
  - to understand and use your data
- what information is needed 
  - for the data to be read and interpreted in the future
- how will you capture
  - create this document and metadata
  - ceating a procedure
  - listing what software you used
  - writing a readme file to accompany the data

## Data storage and backup

- Where do you think you would store your research data
  - Any issues
- Data security levels
  - Level 0
    - unclassified or public information
  - level 1
    - cambridge only (most the data)
  - level 2
    - confidential information
      - meeting minutes
  - level 3
    - personal and strictly confidential
    - names
    - Records 
- Never store level 3 data on a cloud service
  - even the university levels
  - Storage 
  - what kind of level are you working at

## University storage options

- Help uis 
- Engineering department
- storage options: OneDrive
  - Integration with MS365
  - online slide show
  - drag and drop file operations

## Other storage options

- external hard drives
- other domains
- GitHub repositories
- university data stores and data repository
- filing cabinets for paper notes, samples, equipment 
- backup frequently in at least two separate locations

## Sharing your data

- how will you share data?
- wILL YOU HAVE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON DATA sharing?
- Consider when you will share your data
  - Funders often require a timely release of data
- Have you made plans for sharing your data?
  - Discuss in the chat or turn on your microphone to share your thoughts

## Why share research?

- improved reproducbility
- use in education
- applied by practioners
- better value for money
- new research possible around the world
- comply with grant rules
- increased visability
- higher citations
- Improved efficiency
- more collaborations

## University position

- Open research culture
- increasing access to 
- ensure publication open access 
- underlying data
- share propotals

## Open data

- Open data is increasing

## Confidentiality and anonymity

- confidentiality
  - private
  - Reveal this information to third parties
- anonymity
  - assurance to participate

## Data management planning

- data management plans (DMPs)
  - documents you create before collecting and working with data
- what types of research data are you working with?
- what is your strategy for organising your data?
- what is your data backup storage

## Why a DMP

- Data management plans (DMP)
  - ROADMAP TO A GOOD DATa management
  - mandated by funders
  - ensure essential
